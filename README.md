### Results

We list a number of results of composition-aided GAN (CA-GAN) and stacked CA-GAN (SCA-GAN) on the CUHK, CUFSF, and VIPSL-FS databases.  

- `Photo2Sketch`: Synthesize a sketch image from a photo.
- `Sketch2Photo`: Synthesize a photo image from a sketch.
- `cross dataset`: Models are trained on CUHK dataset and tested on VIPSL dataset.

------

- `(WANG)`: WANG's dividing method. Other images are synthesized with the  model that are trained on dataset of our dividing method. 

------

- Each image has five faces (sketches or photos). 
  - 1: Input image
  - 2: Ground truth
  - 3: Synthesized sketch/photo by cGAN
  - 4: Synthesized sketch/photo by CA-GAN
  - 5: Synthesized sketch/photo by SCA-GAN
